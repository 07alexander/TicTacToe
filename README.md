# TicTacToe
Weâ€™re making a Tic Tac Toe game you can play in your browser!

A simple TicTacToe game storing the gameboard as an array inside of a gameboard object. Players will also be stored in objects...also an object will control the flow of the game itself.

Goals:
  1. Avoiding global code using modules and factories. 
  2. Use a JS function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage.
  3. Build functions that allows players to add marks to specific spots on the board tied with the DOM.
  4. Build logic checks for win or lose conditions in a standard Tic Tac Toe game.
  5. Allow players to input their names and include a button to start/restart the game. Add a display element that congratulates the winning player.
  
 Optional:
  1. Add an AI so that a player can play against the computer!
